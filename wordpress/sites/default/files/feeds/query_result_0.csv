He was married for twenty-five years to the late artist and dharma teacher Maggy Sluyter and has two grown children. In 2010 he moved to California and married filmmaker Yaffa Lerea.<br />

<p><img align='left' alt='' hspace='10' src='/sites/default/files/EnlitSmaller.jpg' vspace='3' /> The <strong>LITERATURE OF ENLIGHTENMENT</strong> program is probably the longest-running and most successful nonsectarian classroom meditation program in the United States. It is offered at <a href='http://www.pingry.k12.nj.us/'>The Pingry School</a>, a highly-regarded independent school in central New Jersey, where it is a spring-semester English elective available to juniors and seniors. The course was taught by Dean Sluyter from the late 1970s to 2010, and is now being carried on by others. Students read books approaching the idea of enlightenment from a number of angles and in several world-cultural contexts; they write papers ranging from Salingeresque stories about themselves to haiku journals and Socratic dialogues; and they engage in intensive &quot;lab work&quot; consisting of a variety of meditative techniques.</p>
<p><em>Hear a class session, an introduction to haiku in the context of the enlightenment process:</em></p>
<p><iframe frameborder='no' height='166' scrolling='no' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F72048824&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=false' width='100%'></iframe></p>
<p>The course enjoys strong support from both administration and parents, who generally note a positive effect on the students' behavior and attitudes. Students themselves report feeling less stressed yet more effective in their academic and personal lives. The anonymous evaluations they write at the end of the semester typically include such comments as, &quot;The course opened up a whole new world for me&quot; and &quot;None of my religious beliefs changed, but the course helped me find the spiritual content of my own religion.&quot; Self-destructive behavior such as eating disorders and substance abuse tends to lessen or fall away spontaneously. Graduates of the course now include many adults who, as they have built their families and careers, have continued to enrich their lives with meditative practice.<br />
	<br />
	In addition, beginning in fall 2002 Dean began conducting a new program of <strong>MINDFUL AWARENESS PRACTICE</strong>, which offers a guided sitting two mornings a week to all Pingry faculty and staff and to all students in grades nine through twelve. The program continues to prove highly popular, with a number of students and teachers coming on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>LITERATURE OF ENLIGHTENMENT (#A15212)</strong><br />
	<em>Major semester course. 1-1/2 credits. Forms V-VI.</em><br />
	<br />
	Is there a dimension of boundlessness behind the boundaries of everyday life? Can it be directly experienced? How might such an experience change our lives? In this course we seek to answer these questions through the study of literary and scriptural texts, both Eastern and Western, ancient and modern, as well as through techniques of inner exploration. We encounter the recurrent theme of transformative awakening, or enlightenment: the <em>satori</em> of Zen, the <em>rigpa</em> of the Tibetans, the &quot;zone&quot; of peak athletic performance and artistic creativity, Plato's vision of universal love, the Judeo-Christian kingdom of God within.<br />
	<br />
	Texts include <em>The Heart Sutra, The Gospel of Thomas, The Dharma Bums</em> (Kerouac), <em>The Symposium</em> (Plato), <em>Be Here Now</em> (Ram Dass), <em>Zen Flesh, Zen Bones</em> (Reps), <em>Franny and Zooey </em>(Salinger), <em>The Zen Commandments </em>(Sluyter), and ecstatic poetry of Basho, Blake, Dante, Kabir, Mirabai, and Rumi. Musical interludes may include Tibetan and Gregorian chant, Hindu <em>kirtan</em>, Sufi <em>qawwali</em>, and the devotional jazz of John Coltrane. Writing assignments include haiku, a Salingeresque fictional self-portrait, an original scripture, and a minutely mindful journal of the performance of an everyday activity.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Lab: </strong>In the lab component of the course, students learn traditional techniques of sitting, walking, and breathing meditation, self-inquiry, compassion, and loving-kindness, for experiencing boundless awareness-space as described in the literature.<br />

	- <em>Values &amp; Visions</em></strong><br />
	<br />
	The great spiritual truths are right under your nose - in the songs, jokes, proverbs, and nursery rhymes you've known all your life.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road</strong> (Tarcher/Putnam, February 1998) invites the reader to join in the seriously playful adventure of &quot;digging the cosmic ordinary&quot; - exploring our cultural backyard to discover the profound wisdom hidden there in plain sight.<br />
	<br />
	In thirty-three illustrated mini-chapters, it traces the startling, sometimes hilarious connections between the highest revelations and the lowliest jingles, jokes, and cliches.<br />
	<br />
	Among them:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		&quot;Knock-Knock, Who's There?&quot; teaches the same process of radical self-inquiry advocated by Hindu masters.</li>
	<li>
		&quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; expounds the way of love and devotion as eloquently as the Psalms or the Gospels.</li>
	<li>
		&quot;Easy Does It,&quot; a principle as precise as E=mc2, describes both the workings of the universe and the mechanics of meditation.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		&quot;Home on the Range&quot; celebrates the anarchic freedom of enlightenment.
		<ul>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Author Dean Sluyter shows us that Christ and Buddha bring the same good news of cosmic liberation - and so do Mick Jagger and Ira Gershwin, Bugs Bunny and Alfred E. Neuman. Along the way, he tells lively stories that incorporate basketball and Sufi dancing, cowboy movies and Sabbath mysticism, bebop saxophone practice and Tibetan compassion practice. And he shares spiritual exercises (some traditional, some home-brewed) that are powerfully transformative.<br />
	<br />
	&quot;Sluyter's fresh, enticing and Dada-esque manifesto of found wisdom from the scrap heap of popular culture highlights the right stuff. This dean's instruction goes down easy, nourishes both heart and mind, and tickles the funny bone too. I found plenty of good eggs in his basket.&quot;<br />
	- Lama Surya Das, author of <em>Awakening the Buddha Within</em><br />
	<br />
	&quot;A brilliant, funny, profound and crazy vision of the sacredness in everyday life. I didn't know whether to laugh at its wit or cry at its insight. If Franny and Zooey are your friends, this book will mean a lot to you.&quot;<br />

	<br />
	&quot;This is a witty and wonderfully wise presentation of the freedom of non-desire (but I cannot guarantee that it liberates completely, because I often wished <em>I</em> had written it).&quot;<br />
	- Sylvia Boorstein, author of <em>It's Easier Than You Think</em><br />
	<br />
	&quot;Dean Sluyter is an enthusiast: for language, for life, and for the juice of it all: the rich living gravy that oozes out of every nuance of experience. The nature of reality is our most fundamental teacher and it speaks of itself everywhere and in everything; Dean Sluyter has listened to the rumours for years and now he presents them with delicious fun and lightness.&quot;<br />

	The Ten Commandments tell us how to behave, but they don't say much about the inner awareness from which outer behavior springs. Do the right thing, of course - but better yet, find your inner light and doing the right thing becomes as natural as breathing. Here are ten powerful nudges toward that light. Drawing on sources from Zen stories and the Bible to jazz and rock 'n' roll, from American movies to Tibetan meditative techniques, Dean Sluyter steers clear of dogma and emphasizes what works - a sort of spiritual street smarts. He shows that the state of boundless freedom and happiness isn't something distant or exotic, but is right here, while you're stuck in traffic or taking out the trash. And revisiting the Ten Commandments, he finds that on a deeper level they offer some surprising enlightenment wisdom of their own.<br />

Only a few of these stories touch on the dharma explicitly, and this book takes you on an inward tour across the whole world - to the jungles of Indonesia, a fog-shrouded park in San Francisco, the sun-blistered African veldt, a Burmese monastery surrounded by gun-fire, and the church-like sanctuary of a Nebraska barn, just to name a few. Collectively these stories paint a living portrait of the face of Buddhism, and readers may discover that that face is a strangely familiar one - and that every journey only ever leads home.<br />

This is not merely a reading of the text but a lively, expanded, far-ranging discussion of the book's ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are twelve sessions, each about half an hour long, in which Dean explores spiritual concepts, tells stories, makes connections to everything from Greek mythology to American movies, and leads you step by step through an array of exercises and experiences. Like the book version of <em>The Zen Commandments</em>, this program explores ten &quot;suggestions&quot; (as opposed to commandments) that cover the essential points of inner and outer development, leading to a life of greater ease, balance, and open-heartedness. As with all of Dean's books and workshops, the style is down-to-earth and laced with humor, providing a highly accessible introduction to the possibility of becoming more relaxed, joyous, and enlightened within the demanding context of contemporary life.</p>

She's an utterly passive  fairy-tale heroine who climbs no beanstalks and slays no dragons. She  has no talents but housecleaning and no interests beyond pining away for  that Special Someone who will someday come and solve all her problems.  Her shrill, girly voice attests to her empty-headed helplessness - she's  sisters-under-the-skin with the old politically incorrect Teen Talk  Barbie that sighed, 'Math is hard!' All she is is young and pretty, and  not smart enough to understand that one day, like the Queen, she'll be  forty and washed up. <br /> <br />This sort of critique is valid as long as we're viewing the film on a  strictly literal level. But on that level <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em> teaches us to solve our problems by stealing and killing, and Christ's  parables are pointless stories about pearls and swine, lost sheep and  mustard seeds. If we look at it in the right light and from the right  angle, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>, the first feature-length  cartoon ever made, turns out to be an extended dharma parable, its  teachings as exquisitely detailed as they are unintended. <br /> <br />Back in 1937, when the film was in production, the press called it  'Disney's Folly.' Even Roy Disney, Walt's brother and partner, wanted to  stick to their wildly popular Mickey Mouse shorts, fearful that the  project would sink the studio. Walt kept hiring more artists, hundreds  of them, and going back to the bank for more money. To realize his  vision, new technology was developed (a giant multiplane camera to add  layers of perspective), an in-house art school was established, live  dancers and dwarfs were filmed and copied, chemists mixed 1,500 custom  paint colors, and teams of animators worked around the clock for months,  fired up by Walt's relentless perfectionism. As one artist said,  'Disney had only one rule: whatever we did had to be better than anybody  else could do it, even if you had to animate it nine times.' <br /> <br />The result tapped into something universal, and <em>Snow White</em> became the first great international blockbuster of the sound era. True,  it set in motion the Disney juggernaut-of-cuteness that would  eventually crush every delicate, wistful children's classic in sight  (poor Pooh!), but that's another story. Visually, the film is still  stunning today, in such scenes as the climactic storm, where the fall  and splatter of each individual raindrop is hand-rendered with  painstaking predigital craftsmanship. But most remarkable is how, out of  the intensely concentrated awareness of some 1,000 collaborating  artists (writers, animators, colorists, actors, musicians, and more)  emerged a self-portrait of awareness itself: our pristine, snow-white  inmost being, with its innate yearning to find fulfillment in the arms  of the Prince Charming of enlightenment.  <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />But enlightenment, in all its expansiveness, is an unfamiliar realm.  So the film begins with the all-too-familiar constrictedness of  unenlightenment, in the person of Snow White's stepmother, the Queen,  closeted in the dark, claustrophobic recesses of her strangely  uninhabited castle. Where are the King, the courtiers, the ladies in  waiting? She dwells in isolation, just as we dwell (so it seems) alone  inside a body, a tiny island of self lost in the wide sea of all that is  not our self. Gazing into her mirror, she pronounces her famous  incantation -  <br /> <br /><em>Magic mirror on the wall,  <br />Who is the fairest one of all?</em> <br /> <br /> - just as we try to make ourselves less tiny by being the fairest  (or the richest or strongest or smartest or coolest) one of all. But  because it merely intensifies the sense of self, such  self-aggrandizement is a losing game. Making our island more luxurious  just reinforces the sensation that we're stuck on an island.  <br /> <br />And all such improvements are temporary anyway; we can't stay the  fairest one of all forever. The Queen knows her beauty is doomed, and in  straining to preserve it - another self-defeating strategy - she has  made herself grotesque. Her high cheekbones and flawless skin,  exaggerated by the black cowl pulled tight over her hair and ears, are  fixed in a frozen mask that is not beautiful but an ice-cold, Joan  Crawfordesque parody of beauty: she's like a walking facelift with  nothing beneath it. When she summons the Spirit for reassurance that  she's still the fairest one of all, she addresses him as 'Slave in the  magic mirror,' but <em>she's</em> clearly a slave <em>of</em> the magic  mirror. The words <em>narcissism</em> and <em>narcotic</em> come from the  same root, and the Queen is hooked, a mirror junkie with an expensive  habit.  <br /> <br />The plot is set in motion when the Spirit puts Mommie Dearest in a  rage by revealing that Snow White is now fairest of all. Reflecting the  Queen's frozen features, the Spirit is also drawn as a mask - the  mournful mask of tragedy, the drama of inevitable loss. The Greek word  for mask, <em>persona</em>, is the root of our words <em>person</em> and <em>personality</em>,  implying that the 'person,' the self we work so hard to preserve and  promote, is merely a mask and not what we truly are. That's good news.  Working to earn more money, get a higher SAT score, or, for that matter,  make ourselves more attractive is not the problem; it's the <em>identification</em> with these achievements, the illusion that we <em>are</em> our faces,  brains, or money. Like the Queen, we're happy to be a made-up self as  long as it's succeeding on its own made-up terms. But sooner or later  others arise to challenge us. Then, because of our identification with  the role we've been playing, our very survival seems to require that we  eliminate the challenger. We lash out.  <br /> <br /><em>In ignorance, alienated and lonely, we are cut off from the world  and other creatures by our belief that we are all separate entities. . .  . Hatred or aversion is a direct function of the split mind. . . .  [D]ue to the fear inherent in 'island-consciousness,' when any event  occurs that is not exuding comfort and security . . . the conditions for  a possible violent confrontation are present. <br /> - The Flight of the Garuda</em> <br /> <br />Here this spawning of violence occurs when the Queen summons her  Huntsman to take Snow White into the woods and cut out her heart.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, there's an alternative to isolation, fear, and rage. We  can use the daily threats to our precarious security as opportunities  for insight, to see that these challenges to the false self bring not  doom but redemption. Instead of clutching at the mask with an  ever-tightening grip, we can let go. <br /> <br /><em>Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream. <br />It is not dying, it is not dying. <br /> - Lennon/McCartney,  'Tomorrow Never Knows'</em> <br /> <br />That which overshadows us, we discover by relaxing into it, is not  some outer menace but our own true being - represented here by Snow  White.  <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />Her name, her voice, her face all suggest that Snow White is more  than a literal fairy-tale heroine, that she personifies something beyond  the realm of human limitation. She is Disney's embodiment of 'that  fine, clean, unspoiled spot down deep in every one of us,' as pure as  the driven snow. She was originally drawn with skin so otherworldly  white that the female artists in the ink and paint department, it is  said, had to go back cell by cell, applying rouge from their own makeup  kits to her cheeks. Her voice, so nearly ultrasonic that it's painful,  was not a casual choice. Disney, who had sound equipment specially  installed in his office so he could listen in on auditions, rejected  over a hundred singers before hearing nineteen-year-old Adriana  Caselotti and exclaiming, 'That's the girl!'  <br /> <br />The name Snow White is particularly suggestive. As snow blankets the  entire countryside, it implies a beauty that can't be hoarded, a shared  asset that's vaster than our island of self. Dharma texts use such  terms as <em>sem karpo</em> ('white mind' in Tibetan) to describe that  which underlies all our masks and is 'fairer' - more radiant, more real,  more joyously liberative - than any of them. One popular exercise for  cleansing the mind of impurities that obstruct this awareness, the  Vajrasattva ('white scepter') purification, involves visualizing  enlightenment-nectar 'the color of fresh snow in brilliant sunlight'  pouring down through the top of one's head and flushing out the entire  body. In fact, when we first see Snow White she is engaged in cleansing,  scrubbing the outer steps of the palace, the Queen's fortress of  self-imposed solitude and limitation.  <br /> <br />Looking up at that massive obstruction, Snow White sighs with  discouragement. She is dressed in rags, neglected by her stepmother,  just as our inner being, with no family resemblance to the false self,  is shunted aside like a neglected stepchild. Yet her beauty shines  despite her rags. Our radiant essence, pure awareness, can never be  tainted by the world of mundane experience.  <br /> <br />How can that be? Here's an experiment that can help make it clear:</p><table border='0' cellspacing='3' cellpadding='12' width='100%' height='98%' align='CENTER'><tbody><tr><td valign='TOP'><table border='0' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' width='100'><tbody><tr><td align='RIGHT' valign='TOP'><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td width='100%' valign='TOP' bgcolor='#ffffff'><li>Examine any two objects - say a penny and a dollar. Through your  senses, you experience the penny as round, brownish, and smooth, the  dollar as rectangular, greenish, and crinkly.  <br /><br /></li><li>Notice that these sensations of roundness, crinkliness,  and so forth, are experienced within your awareness. You are aware <em>of</em> them.  <br /><br /></li><li>Now notice whether your awareness itself is brown or  greenish, crinkly or smooth. (Take your time and observe closely.)  Plainly it's none of these, since you can be aware of many colors and  textures at once. <em>Awareness itself</em> is pure - it has no shape,  texture, size, or any other sensory characteristic, but is an unchanging  luminous clarity within which arises the ever-changing display of  sensations.  <br /><br />So, underlying all perception is pure awareness, in the  background of every mind-moment. It just needs to be promoted to the  foreground. The neglected stepchild must take her rightful place as a  princess. <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />Still sighing, Snow White carries her scrub bucket a few yards to a  well, peers into its depths, and sings about her wish for 'the one I  love' to 'find me today.' Our inner nature wants, as it were, to be  found. It's not enough merely to <em>be</em> that luminous clarity; we  must somehow come to <em>know</em> it. This knowing is not an idea or a  feeling but a direct experience - in fact, <em>the</em> experience, <em>satori,  nirvana, rigpa</em>, the peace that passeth understanding, the kingdom  of God within. Here it's represented by the Prince, the one who can draw  Snow White out of the background to which she has been relegated. Sages  in all traditions say this ultimate experience cannot be adequately  described ('The Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao'), and  fittingly, the Prince is the one character the Disney artists were never  satisfied with. They couldn't find a way to make him visually embody  Snow White's ultimate, supremely desirable destiny. Instead he wound up  looking the way many descriptions of enlightenment misleadingly make it  sound: bland and boring. <br /> <br />Because this enlightenment experience is not anything foreign to us  but is the realization of our own basic nature, we're spontaneously  attracted to it - the Prince is Charming. Snow White has never laid eyes  on the guy, but he's already 'the one I love.' This preexisting  affinity makes her confident that he's the one and that, sooner or  later, he'll show up. And the feeling is mutual. Realization is  spontaneously attracted to us; in a moment, the Prince will arrive on a  horse that is also snow-white, implying that Snow White's own pristine  nature carries him toward her. In this context, her Barbie-esque  passivity makes sense after all. The essence of meditation - the most  stripped-down, straightforward technique of realizing the pure nature of  our awareness - is <em>wu wei</em>, 'not doing,' simply letting awareness  be. All forms of spiritual doing exist to bring us to this point of not  doing, where any exertion would merely overlay complications upon the  perfect, snow-white face of what we already are. As a Zen teacher once  put it, 'Enlightenment, when it happens, is an accident. Spiritual  practice just makes us more accident-prone.'  <br /> <br />This is the utter simplicity that makes even the word 'meditation'  seem superfluous. Whether with eyes closed or open, whether cross-legged  on a cushion after intoning mantras or lounging in the backyard after  sipping morning coffee, we just let go, not following our thoughts or  repressing them, not manipulating our experience or judging it. As with  muddy water, if we don't stir it but just let it settle, the medium in  which the mud is suspended spontaneously reveals its innate clarity. We  simply sit, simply be, and, in its time, realization comes unbidden, 'as  a thief in the night,' just as Prince Charming now comes riding onto  the scene, scales the wall, and steals silently into Snow White's  garden. <br /> <br />Oblivious of his presence, Snow White goes on singing, and through  her eyes, in a point-of-view shot that's one of the film's most striking  images, we see her reflection looking back from the bottom of the well.  It's a vivid evocation of the meditative state: awareness simply  resting aware of awareness. <br /> <br /><em>In this there is not a thing to be removed,  <br />Nor anything that needs to be added. <br />It is merely the immaculate,  <br />Looking naturally at itself. <br /> - Khenpo Jamyang Dorje </em> <br /> <br />Oddly, the image recalls the Queen and her mirror, but with a  crucial difference. The Queen strikes a rigid, imperial stance, issuing  commands at horizontal eye level; Snow White bends in a relaxed,  gracefully rounded posture, her head bowed as if in humble prayer,  gazing with gentle acceptance into the vertical depths. And while the  Queen glares at a hard surface that reflects her own rigidity, Snow  White looks into living water, in which circular ripples (a spectacular  artistic tour de force) gently radiate outward across her reflection,  implying that the self she sees is not static and isolated but fluidly  interconnected with everything else. The Queen would be furious if  ripples crossed <em>her</em> face - they would have her running for the  Botox.  <br /> <br />A moment later, the Prince appears at Snow White's side - reflected  in the bottom of the well. This, her first glimpse of him, reminds us  that initially our inner nature can most readily encounter its own  realization in the depths of meditation. But it's always available,  right here and now, as the Prince indicates by singing back the last  word of Snow White's wishing song in an ascending interval that makes it  a triumphant declaration: 'To-<em>day</em>!'  <br /> <br />In principle, this is all we should ever have to do: look into  ourselves once, see what we truly are, and then live the experience. In  practice, though, these glimpses (in Zen they're called <em>kensho</em>)  are highly unstable, due to their unfamiliarity, as we now see when  timid Snow White becomes flustered and runs away. To become permanent,  inner illumination must be hauled up, so to speak, from the bottom of  the well to the surface. In Judaism, where the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is  set aside for such inner experience, a key prayer says, 'Help me to  extend the joy of Shabbat to the other days of the week, until I attain  the goal of deep joy always.' To live happily ever after (in 'deep joy  always') with the Prince, Snow White must leave her sheltered garden for  the outer world - a journey that will take her to the cottage of the  Seven Dwarfs. . . .  <br /><br /> <a href='http://deansluyter.com/pages.cfm?id=198'>Return to Cinema  Nirvana page</a>. </li></td></tr></tbody></table>"

She has no talents but housecleaning and no interests beyond pining away for that Special Someone who will someday come and solve all her problems.

Even Roy Disney, Walt's brother and partner, wanted to stick to their wildly popular Mickey Mouse shorts, fearful that the project would sink the studio. Walt kept hiring more artists, hundreds of them, and going back to the bank for more money. To realize his vision, new technology was developed (a giant multiplane camera to add layers of perspective), an in-house art school was established, live dancers and dwarfs were filmed and copied, chemists mixed 1,500 custom paint colors, and teams of animators worked around the clock for months, fired up by Walt's relentless perfectionism.

True, it set in motion the Disney juggernaut-of-cuteness that would eventually crush every delicate, wistful children's classic in sight (poor Pooh!), but that's another story. Visually, the film is still stunning today, in such scenes as the climactic storm, where the fall and splatter of each individual raindrop is hand-rendered with painstaking predigital craftsmanship. But most remarkable is how, out of the intensely concentrated awareness of some 1,000 collaborating artists (writers, animators, colorists, actors, musicians, and more) emerged a self-portrait of awareness itself: our pristine, snow-white inmost being, with its innate yearning to find fulfillment in the arms of the Prince Charming of enlightenment.&nbsp;</spun><br> <br> <spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'></spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'></spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'></spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'></spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'></spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>But</spun><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'> enlightenment, in all its expansiveness, is an unfamiliar realm. So the film begins with the all-too-familiar constrictedness of unenlightenment, in the person of Snow White's stepmother, the Queen, closeted in the dark, claustrophobic recesses of her strangely uninhabited castle. Where are the King, the courtiers, the ladies in waiting? She dwells in isolation, just as we dwell (so it seems) alone inside a body, a tiny island of self lost in the wide sea of all that is not our self.

In fact, when we first see Snow White she is engaged in cleansing, scrubbing the outer steps of the palace, the Queen's fortress of self-imposed solitude and limitation.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>Looking up at that massive obstruction, Snow White sighs with discouragement. She is dressed in rags, neglected by her stepmother, just as our inner being, with no family resemblance to the false self, is shunted aside like a neglected stepchild. Yet her beauty shines despite her rags. Our radiant essence, pure awareness, can never be tainted by the world of mundane experience.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>How can that be?

(Take your time and observe closely.) Plainly it's none of these, since you can be aware of many colors and textures at once.&nbsp;<i>Awareness itself</i>&nbsp;is pure - it has no shape, texture, size, or any other sensory characteristic, but is an unchanging luminous clarity within which arises the ever-changing display of sensations.</spun></li></ul><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>So, underlying all perception is pure awareness, in the background of every mind-moment. It just needs to be promoted to the foreground. The neglected stepchild must take her rightful place as a princess.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>Still sighing, Snow White carries her scrub bucket a few yards to a well, peers into its depths, and sings about her wish for 'the one I love' to 'find me today.' Our inner nature wants, as it were, to be found. It's not enough merely to&nbsp;<i>be</i>&nbsp;that luminous clarity; we must somehow come to&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;it. This knowing is not an idea or a feeling but a direct experience - in fact,&nbsp;<i>the</i>&nbsp;experience,&nbsp;<i>satori, nirvana, rigpa</i>, the peace that passeth understanding, the kingdom of God within. Here it's represented by the Prince, the one who can draw Snow White out of the background to which she has been relegated. Sages in all traditions say this ultimate experience cannot be adequately described ('The Tao that can be spoken of is not the true Tao'), and fittingly, the Prince is the one character the Disney artists were never satisfied with. They couldn't find a way to make him visually embody Snow White's ultimate, supremely desirable destiny. Instead he wound up looking the way many descriptions of enlightenment misleadingly make it sound: bland and boring.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>Because this enlightenment experience is not anything foreign to us but is the realization of our own basic nature, we're spontaneously attracted to it - the Prince is Charming. Snow White has never laid eyes on the guy, but he's already 'the one I love.' This preexisting affinity makes her confident that he's the one and that, sooner or later, he'll show up. And the feeling is mutual. Realization is spontaneously attracted to us; in a moment, the Prince will arrive on a horse that is also snow-white, implying that Snow White's own pristine nature carries him toward her. In this context, her Barbie-esque passivity makes sense after all. The essence of meditation - the most stripped-down, straightforward technique of realizing the pure nature of our awareness - is&nbsp;<i>wu wei</i>, 'not doing,' simply letting awareness be. All forms of spiritual doing exist to bring us to this point of not doing, where any exertion would merely overlay complications upon the perfect, snow-white face of what we already are. As a Zen teacher once put it, 'Enlightenment, when it happens, is an accident. Spiritual practice just makes us more accident-prone.'&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>This is the utter simplicity that makes even the word 'meditation' seem superfluous. Whether with eyes closed or open, whether cross-legged on a cushion after intoning mantras or lounging in the backyard after sipping morning coffee, we just let go, not following our thoughts or repressing them, not manipulating our experience or judging it. As with muddy water, if we don't stir it but just let it settle, the medium in which the mud is suspended spontaneously reveals its innate clarity. We simply sit, simply be, and, in its time, realization comes unbidden, 'as a thief in the night,' just as Prince Charming now comes riding onto the scene, scales the wall, and steals silently into Snow White's garden.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>Oblivious of his presence, Snow White goes on singing, and through her eyes, in a point-of-view shot that's one of the film's most striking images, we see her reflection looking back from the bottom of the well. It's a vivid evocation of the meditative state: awareness simply resting aware of awareness.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><i>In this there is not a thing to be removed,&nbsp;</i></spun><br> <spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><i>Nor anything that needs to be added.&nbsp;</i></spun><br> <spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><i>It is merely the immaculate,&nbsp;</i></spun><br> <spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><i>Looking naturally at itself.&nbsp;</i></spun><br> <spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><i>- Khenpo Jamyang Dorje&nbsp;</i></spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>Oddly, the image recalls the Queen and her mirror, but with a crucial difference. The Queen strikes a rigid, imperial stance, issuing commands at horizontal eye level; Snow White bends in a relaxed, gracefully rounded posture, her head bowed as if in humble prayer, gazing with gentle acceptance into the vertical depths. And while the Queen glares at a hard surface that reflects her own rigidity, Snow White looks into living water, in which circular ripples (a spectacular artistic tour de force) gently radiate outward across her reflection, implying that the self she sees is not static and isolated but fluidly interconnected with everything else. The Queen would be furious if ripples crossed&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;face - they would have her running for the Botox.&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>A moment later, the Prince appears at Snow White's side - reflected in the bottom of the well. This, her first glimpse of him, reminds us that initially our inner nature can most readily encounter its own realization in the depths of meditation. But it's always available, right here and now, as the Prince indicates by singing back the last word of Snow White's wishing song in an ascending interval that makes it a triumphant declaration: 'To-<i>day</i>!'&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'>In principle, this is all we should ever have to do: look into ourselves once, see what we truly are, and then live the experience. In practice, though, these glimpses (in Zen they're called&nbsp;<i>kensho</i>) are highly unstable, due to their unfamiliarity, as we now see when timid Snow White becomes flustered and runs away. To become permanent, inner illumination must be hauled up, so to speak, from the bottom of the well to the surface. In Judaism, where the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is set aside for such inner experience, a key prayer says, 'Help me to extend the joy of Shabbat to the other days of the week, until I attain the goal of deep joy always.' To live happily ever after (in 'deep joy always') with the Prince, Snow White must leave her sheltered garden for the outer world - a journey that will take her to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. . . .&nbsp;</spun></p><p><spun class='Apple-style-span' style='funt-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; funt-size: 14px; line-hoight: 18px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;'><a href='/content/cinema-nirvana' style='text-decoration: underline; color: #203e80;'>Return to Cinema Nirvana page</a>.</spun></p>"

When the first sentence in a book about Zen refers to Gene Kelly, you know you're not in for one hand clapping. Rather, it's both hands clapping for joy in&nbsp;<i>The Zen Commandments</i>&nbsp;by Dean Sluyter. . . . The commandments are in fact &quot;suggestions,&quot; the author says, to help develop &quot;a life of inner freedom.&quot; A &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; attitude - joyfully jumping in puddles - is what seekers should (though&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;isn't a useful attitude) be after. The book includes quotations from Zen masters and other sages, but there are also Willie Nelson, Miles Davis and Bob Dylan . . . and Homer Simpson.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>From PUBLISHERS WEEKLY&nbsp;</i></b><br />
Meditation teacher Sluyter (<i>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road and Other Hidden Enlightenment Teachings</i>) draws 10 life &quot;suggestions&quot; from the world's religions, scriptures, philosophers, literature and popular culture (in his words, &quot;any tradition that promotes compassionate outer behavior and enlightened inner awareness&quot;). Sluyter's suggestions involve acting with kindness, noticing the moment, keeping things simple, blessing others and remaining devoted. His sources include Jesus and the Dalai Lama, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bob Dylan, Monty Python and Ramana Maharshi, the Wizard of Oz and the Prajnaparamita Sutra. The strength of this eclecticism is that the book is extremely well written and joyously entertaining. . . . Sluyter's point - that we often make life too complex when we really need to just relax and be - is a simple one, as are pithy maxims such as &quot;No Appointment, No Disappointment.&quot; For those who find simplicity hard to attain, his chapters also include exercises in meditation. The book enthusiastically suggests that readers experiment and adhere to anything that works for them &quot;as if your life depended on it,&quot; because, according to Sluyter, it actually does.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>From&nbsp;</strong></em><a href='http://www.spiritualrx.com/'><strong><em>Spiritual Rx</em></strong></a></p><p>I got a kick out of Dean Sluyter's last book&nbsp;<i>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road and Other Hidden Enlightenment Teachings from Buddha to Bebop to Mother Goose</i>. As a leading innovator in the use of meditative techniques in education, he now has patched together some spiritual practices and propositions that can support the lurch we all have toward &quot;a life of inner freedom.&quot; It will appeal to those who are uncomfortable around dogma.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sluyter quotes Lester Bangs: &quot;I just like people with some Looney Tune in their souls.&quot; Not a bad description of the author, who playfully uses colorful illustrative material from Zen masters, Jesus, Tibetan meditators, Bob Dylan, Joyce Carol Oates, J. D. Salinger, and many others. In ten chapters, Sluyter presents spiffy suggestions for living a full life of integrity including rest in openness, notice the moment, keep it simple, be devoted, bless everyone, and be a mensch and enjoy the joke.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At the outset, the author admonishes us to view all that he presents as &quot;lab work&quot; to be tried in the precincts of everyday life. But tapping into our inner boundlessness doesn't mean navel-gazing - it leads to concrete acts of kindness. While we are singing in the rain like Gene Kelly in the movie, we must remember to pass the umbrella to the stranger. &quot;Kindness must be guided by alert intelligence; it must include&nbsp;<i>consideration</i>, the habit of considering the actual consequences of what we do.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check out&nbsp;<i>The Zen Commandments</i>&nbsp;by Dean Sluyter and you'll learn a lot about beauty, compassion, saints, teachers, being present, humility, simplicity, and devotion.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>From AMAZON.COM EDITORIAL REVIEWS</i></b></p><p>In Dean Sluyter's clever&nbsp;<i>The Zen Commandments</i>, the author lays down 10 guidelines for living a more present life and experiencing moment-to-moment awareness. Some of his &quot;commandments&quot; are Zen interpretations of the 10 laws Moses brought down from Mount Sinai; others have nothing to do with the prophet's inscribed tablets. In one example, Sluyter takes the Fourth Commandment - Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy - and gives it a Zen twist:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;The whole idea of Sabbath is a temporary withdrawal from limited worldly activities in order to connect to the limitlessness that some people call God. Here . . . we're learning to be in a state of utter rest seven days a week, 60 seconds a minute, transcending and silently witnessing all physical and mental activities, even while performing them.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Through the moment-to-moment awareness that Zen demands, we constantly stay in touch with God, or the Infinite (or whatever individuals choose to call it), Sluyter reminds us. Other Zen commandments are more contemporary and have nothing to do with biblical precepts. Perhaps one of his most useful guidelines is his enjoinder to &quot;Notice the Moment&quot;:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;On our journey through life, we think of the time we spend walking down the hall from Office A to Office B as intermission, dead time, mere connective tissue. But there is no intermission. The show never stops. Every moment is the only moment.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sluyter sprinkles his chapters with eclectic quotes from Bob Dylan, Indian gurus, Miles Davis, Franz Kafka, even Bill Clinton. This is a lively book and one that will almost certainly give you pause in your day, whether it's to simply stop and take a breath while rushing through your morning routine, or to notice the roadside flowers while stalled in rush-hour traffic.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>From NAPRA REVIEW</i></b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Gradually emerging as perhaps the most deeply transformative pathways are nondualistic approaches to spiritual meaning. These distillations of higher wisdom invariably conclude that the answers are within - that which you seek is you - but they must be pursued with rigor and clear intention. It's certainly not an original notion, but the difference now is growing openness to the direct-to-Divine message, especially when presented in jargon-free terms. . . . [Such a book] is the witty and wise&nbsp;<i>The Zen Commandments: Ten Suggestions for a Life of Inner Freedom&nbsp;</i>by Dean Sluyter. Sluyter turns those ten pesky demands into propositions while adding layers of meaning and insight gleaned from his years as a student of Western culture and Eastern mysticism. His goal sounds modest: &quot;[To provide] skillful methods for making freedom and kindness vivid in your own life, by your own choice.&quot; But if that's the least that any of these books accomplishes, then it will be a beautiful thing indeed.</p>"

<p><span style='color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small;'>I grew up about a mile from the spot where the pivotal scene of&nbsp;<em>Gone with the Wind</em>&nbsp;was filmed - the one where Scarlett O'Hara, starving and desperate, shakes her fist at the sky and swears, &quot;As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!&quot; Through the rest of the film we watch her fulfill her vow . . . sort of. She struggles to attain the perfect home, business, marriage, and family, she gets everything she sets her sights on, yet none of it works out quite the way she had hoped. There's always some problem, and her hunger is never satisfied. As the movie ends, she's still scheming: &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style='color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small;'>Sometimes it seems as if, like Scarlett, we're spending our lives dealing with problems and hustling for the things that are supposed to fulfill us. Yet fulfillment is always just beyond our grasp, in some indefinite tomorrow. The First Suggestion addresses this predicament.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style='color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small;'><strong>A Parable</strong>&nbsp;</span><br />
	<span style='color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small;'>Consider the waves of the ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style='color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small;'>At any given moment, a wave is limited in space: extending from Point A to Point B, it's just so big and no bigger, isolated by the troughs that separate it from other waves. It's also limited in time: it arose at some moment in the past and will crash against the shore at some moment in the future. And it's never at rest but is in constant, turbulent motion.</span></p>
<p><img alt='' src='/sites/default/files/tzc.waves_.jpg' style='width: 500px; height: 131px; ' /></p>
<p>Like waves, all the things I encounter are limited, isolated, and in motion, and so am I. From&nbsp;<em>my&nbsp;</em>Point A to Point B is just 5'10&quot; and 153 pounds, and not only my body but my personality, history, philosophy, social status, net worth - everything I might identify with Me is dwarfed by the much larger totality of Not Me. Within the great expanse of time it's a frighteningly short span from the moment of my birth to the moment when I will crash against the shore we call death. And both I and all the other finite, wavelike beings undergo the turbulence of constant activity and change, often creating new problems and limitations as we slosh up against each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
	<span style='font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-size: small; color: #222222;'>Most of us respond to this situation by looking for ways to swell up our Me wave as big as possible. If I can inflate myself with just a few more buckets of money, knowledge, affection, muscles, prestige, sharper clothes, cooler attitudes, more intense sensations, maybe I'll finally overcome limitation and become the King of All Waves. Or maybe I can overcome the ravages of time and death by freezing all waves in place - after I get them to stop sloshing and line up&nbsp;<em>my&nbsp;</em>way. Then everything will stay the way I want it and I'll live forever.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	But history books and the tragedies of Shakespeare are full of people trying these strategies, and they haven't worked yet. Perhaps, then, I might be ready to try a new strategy. I can begin by noticing that I've considered only the surface of life, the world above Dotted Line C. If I look beneath it, I find that something underlies my little wave - the vast ocean, from which I arise and into which I eventually subside.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>You cannot conceive the many without the one.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Plato&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Unlike waves, the ocean is not limited to puny sizes and shapes, and while wave after wave crashes into oblivion, the ocean lives on. What's more, the ocean connects every wave to every other wave, dissolving isolation, and it's immune to the turbulence of change - even when there are tempests at the surface, the ocean rests in its bed in perfect tranquility.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	What I want to do, then, is be more like the ocean. What separates me from it? Amazingly, nothing. The closer we look for the division between wave and ocean, the clearer it becomes that there isn't any. Dotted Line C is merely an imaginary structure in a diagram. In fact, there's no such &quot;thing&quot; as a wave, no such limited, self-existent object. It's just a function of the limitless ocean, a way the ocean expresses itself. So my quest to overcome limitation has been misdirected all along. Instead of trying to swell my wave higher or manipulate the other waves to suit me, I can just settle into my overlooked base till I fully experience that I've been ocean all along.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Of course this is just an analogy (and a very old one, by the way). What&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>that ocean? Here words tend to break down. We can say it's not anything that is, but the is-ness by which all things are. We can say it's the boundless awareness-space within which all boundaries are experienced. We can also say it's what you really want whenever you think you want anything else. Or we can say it's where the sound of the bell goes as it fades into silence, where the knot goes when it's untied, where the steeple goes as it tapers into the sky. And if we like this kind of language, we can say it's the kingdom of God, the ground of Being, the Over-soul, Brahman (vastness), shunyata (emptiness), Tao, Allah, infinity, eternity.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>&quot;I don't call it anything,&quot;&nbsp;<br />
	Said Frankie Lee with a smile.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Bob Dylan&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Since all names are inadequate anyway, perhaps that's our wisest course - to agree not to label it and focus instead on how to experience it. We're not talking about believing in the ocean or singing its praises, but being good scientists and checking out the situation for ourselves through direct, immediate experience - diving&nbsp;<em>into&nbsp;</em>the ocean.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Lab &quot;Work&quot;&nbsp;</strong><br />
	<br />
	How can we dive in? Essentially, by letting go and doing nothing. Anything else will result in our splashing around and churning water, creating more turbulence. Instead, we need to take a break from all that doing and just rest. Of course, we already rest when we sleep, but then we fall unconscious and stop experiencing. Instead, we need to&nbsp;<em>consciously</em>&nbsp;do nothing, take it easy alertly, repose in wide-awakeness: REST IN OPENNESS.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	So, time for some lab work . . . or, rather, nonwork. Please sit someplace where you're comfortable and out of people's way.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	OK?&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Pull your shoulders up to your ears and then drop them. Settle into the seat - let it take all your weight. Because we're so used to speeding along on the expressway of doing, we can start with a bit of breathing practice as a sort of deceleration lane, an offramp to nondoing. Take a slow, full breath, hold it for a few moments, then let out a deep sigh, as if breathing out through all your pores, letting go of everything, all burdens and decisions, stress and distress:&nbsp;<em>Ahhh!&nbsp;</em>Do this a few times.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Then just sit. That's all. Don't try to concentrate on anything or feel a certain way. Don't resist thoughts or pursue them; as they arise, just let them go. Simply continue to&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;- just relax and remain aware, naturally open, as you already are. Practice this way for a little while, and then we'll discuss it further.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Nothing to it . . . literally.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	In Zen this alert nondoing is called&nbsp;<em>shikantaza,&nbsp;</em>&quot;just sitting.&quot; People often call it &quot;meditation,&quot; but again we're probably better off not calling it anything. Otherwise, it can sound like something that requires effort: concentrating on this, blocking out that, assuming solemn attitudes or adopting arcane beliefs - all merely new, improved ways to churn the water. Instead we just sit, just be, and let whatever happens happen. (For more on sitting, please see Appendix, page 143.)&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>No Cigar</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	In fact, openness exists naturally, from moment to moment of our actual lives, while sitting practice just attunes us to&nbsp;<em>recognize&nbsp;</em>it in those moments. You could be walking down a forest path or a supermarket aisle, singing in the choir or slamming in the mosh pit, tooling down Pacific Coast Highway on your Harley or crawling through the Lincoln Tunnel in your Chevy - as long as your awareness is open wide and you're resting in each moment of simple experience, allowing it to unfold spontaneously.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>I am become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me. . . .&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Emerson&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	We're all attracted to activities we find conducive to this union of alertness and restfulness. For some people golf or gardening, dancing or shooting hoops, taking Communion or sitting back with a cigar provides just the right balance of elements. My father was always happiest when he was sailing his boat in the Catalina Channel, vigilantly trimming his sails while serenely losing himself in the clear horizon. We can't sail our boats all the time, but by resting in openness we can sail through life. We can develop a new habit of attentive tranquility that is content-free - like sitting back with a cigar, only without the cigar.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	So the way to boundless experience is to not seek boundless experience or&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>particular experience beyond whatever presents itself. This nonseeking does take practice, not to get &quot;better&quot; at &quot;doing&quot; it, since there's no doing involved, but to give our old seeking habit some road upon which to run out of gas. Sooner or later, we give up and just let the infinite (or whatever you want to call it) engulf us. By definition, the infinite is everywhere and everything; ocean can never be absent from even the smallest drop of wave. We've simply been distracted from it by our constant compulsion to look somewhere else for something more.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Pushing, Pulling, and Freedom</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	This one change changes everything. As we gradually learn to leave off distractedness and rest in openness, we stop looking for fulfillment outside of the way things already are. Till now we've gone through life&nbsp;<em>pushing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>pulling</em>&nbsp;- trying to push the undesirable away from us and pull the desirable toward us. It's such an entrenched habit that we persist even when there's no payoff, when it only creates frustration. Stuck in the traffic jam, we keep trying to push the cars out of the way with our mental bulldozer; spotting the luscious babe (or hunk), we keep trying to extend our mental tendrils and pull her (or him) within copulation range.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	But resting in openness, free from the agitation of pushing and pulling, we can just witness the situation. This doesn't mean to suppress our anger at the traffic if it arises or our lust for the babe if it arises, for those arisings are also part of the situation we're witnessing. But it means we don't get lost in the arisings either, don't fixate on them.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>Elevate the scope of 360-degree global awareness.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Lama Surya Das&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	To be open is to be receptive to all 360 degrees of our experience, not stuck in the five or ten degrees where we're pushing or pulling.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Watch a child get a vaccination and see how he ignores the hundreds of square inches of skin surface that feel fine, perversely squeezing his whole attention into the hundredth of a square inch that's in pain. Most of us are experts at this, fixating on our stresses and traumas, maintaining them as carefully as an album of family photos.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>We tend our pain meticulously through the familiar process of thinking about it. The more we think around our emotional pain the more we cripple ourselves with the artificial intensity of it. . . . We could allow our pain to dissolve into the skylike open-ness of direct experience; but somehow we feel more secure with our pain as a reference point.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Ngak'chang Rinpoche&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Now, though, as we grow increasingly at home with that 360-degree &quot;skylike openness of direct experience,&quot; we find our cozy habit of cultivating and magnifying problems melting into it like summer clouds.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Being open to 360 degrees doesn't mean keeping track of everything, like some kind of fish-eye security camera. Whenever we notice we're fixating we just let go, and then remain naturally receptive to whatever appears. We can also reclaim this receptivity a few degrees at a time. For example, right now, take a few moments and notice all the layers of sound (the voices in the next room, the air conditioner or the radiator or the rain dripping off the leaves . . . ). Or notice the full range of your peripheral vision, which is surprisingly wide; then, each time you realize that your visual attention has narrowed into its old tunnel, relax out into its full range again. Or as you sit through a lecture or a business meeting, notice your tactile sense: the pressure of your butt against the chair and your feet against the floor, the varied textures of clothing against your skin, the temperature of the air on your face and hands. Or notice thoughts and feelings as they emerge, shift, and vanish - notice how they, in a way, are also sense objects of a subtler kind.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>The End of Boredom</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	As panoramic receptivity gradually replaces limited fixation, every situation becomes a glimpse of limitlessness. Let's say you're stuck at a red light and you find yourself gripping the wheel, straining subtly forward, fixated on trying to make the red light turn green. Of course straining can't turn the light green a moment sooner, although it may turn your knuckles white. So rest in openness instead. Liberated from pushing and pulling, from trying to turn the situation into what it isn't, sit back and relax into the richness of what is - the weight of your body against the seat, the morning light glinting off glass and chrome, the chug of idling engines, and the multicolored river of car bodies, each enfolding the mysterious, shadowy figure of a driver.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	And maybe, with your freer vision, you'll even notice that you can cut over a block to a clearer street. By helping us see out of our ruts, openness leads to open-mindedness, receptivity to new experiences and ideas. It does this by freeing us from a third habit, along with pushing and pulling:&nbsp;<em>ignoring,&nbsp;</em>the screening out of &quot;irrelevant&quot; experiences that aren't obviously desirable or undesirable. Then the mind starts to function in a more playful, fluid, creative way, to explore the wide world of possibilities beyond the horizon of our old thoughts and plans, to notice overlooked solutions and wonderful surprises.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>The end men looked for cometh not, And a path there is where no man thought.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Euripides,&nbsp;<em>Medea&nbsp;</em><br />
	<br />
	As we unlearn the habit of ignoring, we regain the freshness of a child's perception. (Jesus said, &quot;Unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot;) We again behold in wonder the dust particles that swim in a sunbeam, or an airplane as it miraculously hums and booms across the sky, or our own surrealistically foreshortened reflection in the toaster or cereal spoon. We again see magical shapes in the clouds, even as we seamlessly handle our grownup responsibilities. There's no conflict between these two modes: we can be childlike without being childish.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>If, when hearing that I have been stilled at last, they stand at the door,&nbsp;<br />
	Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees,&nbsp;<br />
	Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more,&nbsp;<br />
	&quot;He was one who had an eye for such mysteries&quot;?&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Thomas Hardy&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Life, it turns out, is never stale. What made it seem stale was our pushing, pulling, and ignoring it. &quot;Boredom,&quot; says Ram Dass, &quot;is just lack of attention.&quot; In this perpetual freshness of open attention, you don't need to keep jumping off bridges on a bungee cord or jumping into bed with different partners just to know you're alive. Compulsions and addictions naturally start falling away. You can, if you like, be a Buddha of the Burbs, mowing the lawn in summer amazement, shoveling the snow in winter amazement. Your life regains and retains that new-car smell.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Unbusying</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	All this comes from just resting open to each moment as it is. Ironically, though, such ease requires vigilance - our penchant for getting caught up in things is so powerful. One of my teachers recommends deliberately interrupting our busy-ness at least fifty or sixty times a day.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>When you find yourself in the thick of it Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Lennon/McCartney&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	If you have an alarm on your watch, you can set it to go off at odd intervals and remind you to take an awareness break, even for a few seconds. When you're watching television or working at a computer, occasionally look away from the screen, breathe out&nbsp;<em>(Ahhh!),&nbsp;</em>let your mind decompress, and simply be, relaxing into the panorama of the moment's experience. When you're caught up in an intense, engrossing conversation, air it out with tiny, sporadic moments of silence in which you let the forgotten, wider totality of existence break through. When your awareness feels pinched by the pressure of some problematic life situation, step back from the problem, drop out of the pinchedness, hang out in openness.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Does this opening up and dropping out sound like spacing out - evading responsibility? Actually, by refreshing the mind, it helps us deal with life more effectively. Our responsibilities are still there; we just start to see them in a wider perspective. True, we may see that many things we worried about are out of our hands. Then we can conscientiously handle the things we can do something about and let the rest go, rather than keep bashing our heads against them. But that's a good thing - that's a relief.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>Fortunately, we're not in control.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Willie Nelson&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Out of Egypt</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	In fact, this dropping-out process is so important, it's mandated in the Ten Commandments:&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.&nbsp;</em><br />
	<br />
	The sabbath is the day of rest, and to keep something holy is to use it as a means of opening to the infinite. The whole idea of sabbath is a temporary withdrawal from limited worldly activities (waves) in order to reconnect with the limitlessness (ocean) that some people call God. Here we're practicing this principle on the most profound level, resting not only one day out of seven and not only from the physical activities of our jobs, but gradually learning to be in a state of utter rest seven days a week, sixty seconds a minute, transcending and silently witnessing all physical and mental activities, even while performing them.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Then we also fulfill the First Commandment:&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before Me.&nbsp;</em><br />
	<br />
	The Hebrew word for Egypt,&nbsp;<em>Mitzraim</em>, is a plural noun with associated meanings of &quot;confines, constrictions, narrow places,&quot; as well as &quot;anguish, distress, worries.&quot; Thus the first sentence can be read: &quot;I am the ultimate reality, the wide-open limitlessness that has freed you from the anguish of all narrow limitations.&quot; Note that the phrase &quot;brought you out,&quot; past tense, implies that we're already free. There's nothing for us to&nbsp;<em>do</em>, just refrain from&nbsp;<em>re-</em>enslaving ourselves, from getting caught up again in pushing and pulling at the multitude of limited experiences; stop submitting to their power, making them &quot;other gods&quot; as if&nbsp;<em>they&nbsp;</em>were ultimate. Instead let go (as Moses tells Pharaoh), rest in openness, and experience that the only ultimate is the one that is right here, now, amidst all the limitations. We could paraphrase the Commandment as: &quot;I am the supreme, oceanic boundlessness that has saved you from all wavelike turbulence and constriction. Don't go back to it by mistaking any single wave for the whole ocean.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Taking Out the Trash</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Well then. What does it all come down to?&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Taking out the trash.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	After all this fancy cosmic talk, there you are, taking out the trash again - perhaps not one of your favorite activities. This presents you with a choice. You can grumble, narrowing your awareness into a vaccination-sized throb of resentment. Or you can distract yourself with a fantasy of being elsewhere (like those bumper stickers: I'D RATHER BE WATERSKIING). Or, instead, you can rest from both resentment and fantasy, and open into the awareness of what's actually there - the weight of the trash bag pulling on the muscles of your arm, footstep on gravel, footstep on gravel, footstep on gravel, the smell of night air, the receding of the noise and business within the house, the crickets or cicadas or rumbling traffic, the stars or fog or moonlit clouds, and perhaps a taste of the subtle, silent, indefinable Whatsis behind it all. Suddenly it's as rich an experience as you could possibly want.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	The mundane is the sublime. Jesus says, &quot;Knock and it shall be opened unto you.&quot; That is, give your undistracted attention to whatever presents itself, and its stubborn opaqueness will open unto you, revealing glorious transparency. One Zen practitioner described this experience as feeling &quot;free as a fish in an ocean of cool, clear water after being stuck in a tank of glue.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	To see it, there's never anything else you need or need to get rid of, not a pinch more or less than whatever's at hand. Wherever you are is the perfect place to rest in openness. Everything's grist for the mill, as long as the mill wheel is turning - as long as you're paying effortless, panoramic attention. Then it's all vast openness: washing the dishes, cleaning the kitty litter, listening to annoying political opinions, making love or stubbing your toe, dying or being born. You'll forget a million times, and a million and one times you'll remember: Oh, yes . . . this is it . . . just this . . . rest in this.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Everything points to it. It fills all directions. We peer through telescopes to see into the depths of space, but we're&nbsp;<em>in&nbsp;</em>deep space all along - there's nowhere else to be. Contemplating a mountain plateau or a sparkling sea may give us some feel for openness, but the real thing is everywhere, even in the most cluttered storeroom or crowded subway car. It has (it&nbsp;<em>is</em>) unlimited room for everything, including all our clutter and claustrophobia, without ever becoming a drop less vast.<br />
	<br />
	<em>Enlightenment is nothing other than the spontaneous experience of all possible structures as equivalent to open space.</em>&nbsp;<br />
	- Prajnaparamita Sutra&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	When everything is equivalent to open space, nothing impinges on us. We finally discover that all the closedness that we thought was hemming us in was a mistake of perception - a sort of optical illusion. Every little wave is measureless ocean, including the one called Me.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>You, therefore, are the infinite. &quot;I am not the infinite&quot; is a mere illusion. From illusion springs separation wherein all sorrows have root.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Shankaracharya&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	So . . . what? So enjoy being, and cut the root of sorrows. Sit down and &quot;meditate&quot; in silence; get up and navigate through activity; either way, just relax and remain aware. That's it - your job is done. Again and again, and with growing clarity, we discover that,&nbsp;<em>no matter what's going on</em>, we can find perfect freedom by resting in openness to the totality of present awareness. As long as we're caught up in this or that, pushing or pulling, trick or treat, we're in the land of Mitzraim, the house of slavery. As long as we're resting in openness, wherever we are is the Promised Land.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	<em>The narrow straits of our tribulation are limited: but the large way whereby we pass along hath no end.&nbsp;</em><br />
	- Saint Augustine&nbsp;</span></p>

This is a GREAT book! Sluyter doesn't miss a beat in his praise of the sacred and the profane on the path of spiritual enlightenment. His multi-denominational pearls of wisdom are sown through a unique nursery rhyme hopper of eloquent transliteration. Nursery rhymes - really - along with cosmic jokes, exploding proverbs, and accidental hymns are the vehicles in this primer on God and spiritual unfoldment based on the premise that &quot;if we listen closely enough, all jokes are cosmic, all songs are hymns, all proverbs and nursery rhymes are . . . hidden wisdom teachings.&quot; &quot;I'm a Little Teapot,&quot; &quot;She Loves Me/She Loves Me Not,&quot; &quot;Easy Does It,&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, We're the Monkees&quot; are but a few of the gems broadcast on &quot;Radio Free Buddha,&quot; where God sings in the shower and Buddha-nature is open to everyone, &quot;no belief required.&quot; Excellent reading, &quot;beyond belief&quot;!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>From VALUES AND VISIONS</em></strong><br />
&quot;Even the homeliest cultural artifacts contain information that can incite our spiritual unfoldment,&quot; writes Dean Sluyter in&nbsp;<em>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road.</em>&nbsp;The author, who has taught nonsectarian approaches to meditation for more than 25 years, believes that &quot;digging the cosmic ordinary&quot; is one of the spin-offs of enlightenment. This smart, sassy, and idiosyncratic spiritual resource is divided into sections on cosmic jokes, sacred nursery rhymes, exploding proverbs, and accidental hymns. &quot;From the bottom of our morning cereal bowl, from the tail-lights of the car ahead of us, from the eyes of the stranger and our own eyes in the mirror-from every inch and moment of experience, the Subtle Vast One plays peekaboo with us.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><br />
Sluyter proves to be a subtle and imaginative guide through the contemporary world of pop culture dazzling us with epiphanies growing out of jingles, jokes, and folk sayings. He provides fresh takes on faith, devotion, grace, being present, beauty, practice, selflessness, forgiveness, and simplicity. Like the best spiritual teachers, Sluyter lets light in from many angles-in this case, the wisdom of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and more.&nbsp;<em>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road</em>&nbsp;is a surefire demonstration of why play is an essential ingredient in spiritual growth.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>From AQUARIUS</em></strong><br />
<em>by Patricia Santhuff</em></p><p>Who'd have thought it? The profound cleverly hidden within the everyday and even the profane.&nbsp;</p><p>Dean Sluyter did.&nbsp;</p><p>Seventeen years of teaching a daring, ambitious, and wildly popular elective class called &quot;The Literature of Enlightenment&quot; to intelligent 17 year olds at an upscale prep school in New Jersey has taught him a lot: just as all spiritual masters through the ages have said, the divine and hints of high spiritual truth are everywhere, absolutely everywhere, even in some (all?) of the most secular places.&nbsp;</p><p>And Sluyter proves it wittily and entertainingly in his book,&nbsp;<em>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road.</em>&nbsp;In 32 delightful and provocative little essays, Sluyter explores the surprising spiritual truths to be found in childhood ditties like &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; and &quot;Ring Around the Rosy,&quot; in pop culture jokes such as &quot;Knock-Knock, Who's There?,&quot; and the irrepressible Henny Youngman line, &quot;Take My Wife - Please!&quot; He even finds enlightenment or lyrics pointing to spiritual truths in the Rolling Stones' &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction.&quot; In fact, Sluyter, just as Buddha did, finds enlightenment simply everywhere. And he shares those insights so readers are sure to begin to see it everywhere too. Each essay is as uplifting and refreshing, as inspiring and eye-opening, as a half-hour's meditation.&nbsp;</p><p>Readers have told Sluyter that the quality of their own meditation practice changed after reading his book, and others who aren't meditators said, &quot;Something's changed. I feel more relaxed all the time.&quot; Psychologists are buying it in quantity to share with their clients. Even Christian clergy are among the book's fans. But then Sluyter goes out of his way to be an equal-opportunity distributor of enlightenment, tipping his hat to the various world religions and even (most delightfully!) frequently using the feminine pronoun to refer to a realized master. His message is unmistakable, the Divine is everywhere, in everyone and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>In town recently for a booksigning with his wife Maggy, the illustrator for this charming book, Sluyter shared with me that his own first glimmer of enlightenment came with Mad magazine's famous &quot;What, me worry?&quot; Contemplating that refrain liberated him, he said, from the typically obsessive thoughts of an otherwise typical teenager, at least for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Sluyter considers his book very practical. &quot;I'm a rubber meets the road kind of practitioner,&quot; he grinned. Having practiced meditation himself twice a day for 30 years (and having taught it for 20), he offers up some terrific, no-nonsense bits of advice on the subject. &quot;My chapter on meditation, 'Easy Does It,' is very practical and helpful, I think. As soon as you say 'trying to,' you're wrong. It's a shock to people to learn how easy meditation is. The more you practice, the more you get used to seeing that is was always easy,&quot; he explained.&nbsp;</p><p>The book is replete with a beautiful, open-hearted sort of permission to be exactly who you are and to see the world as okay exactly as it is, I said. &quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Sluyter. &quot;Ram Dass once said, 'When all else fails, try being human.'&quot; Human, it turns out, is just as enlightened as anything else. Or, as Buddha said upon reaching enlightenment, &quot;How wonderful! How wonderful! All things are enlightened exactly as they are.&quot; Mostly, we've just forgotten. But Sluyter helps us begin to remember again.&nbsp;</p><p>Sluyter takes pride in the absolute subversiveness of his &quot;Literature of Enlightenment&quot; course. &quot;I'm filling Harvard and Princeton and corporate boardrooms with people who sat with me learning the Heart Sutra,&quot; he beams. (What a breathtaking thought!) As a result of his book, he reports, people at other schools are calling for advice about setting up their own non-sectarian curriculum. (Yet another breathtaking thought!)&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of our meeting, I asked him what he really wanted people to know. He thought for a long while, as if sorting carefully through the myriad spiritual truths he might share.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I want them to know that this is it. This moment, as it is. Your awareness in this moment, not when you get to the end of the sentence and get some understanding and say Aha! It's already Aha! This whole universe and every particle of it is already Aha! And sooner or later you'll cease struggling and allow yourself to notice it. So why not sooner?&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Why not indeed?&nbsp;<em>Why the Chicken Crossed the Road</em>&nbsp;offers a witty, entertaining, yet very profound, path to sooner.&nbsp;</p>"

	True story:</p>
<p>A San Fernando Valley afternoon in 1961. I'm twelve years old. My family is planning to see a drive-in movie later in the evening, and my mother sends me to the garage to clean out our Rambler station wagon. As I gather up the toys and clothes and comic books my brothers and I have left there, my hyperactive mind is, as usual, rehearsing and rehashing conversations, fretting over eventualities, calculating consequences. I am, as usual, utterly unaware of the noisy, agitated way my mind is functioning, both because my mind has&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;been this busy (I have nothing to compare it to) and because it is so busy (it's too caught up in chasing and snapping at its own tail to notice that it's caught up).</p>
<p>The next item I find on the backseat is a&nbsp;<em>Mad</em>&nbsp;magazine. I glance at the cover, with its picture of the magazine's idiot mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, and read his motto:&nbsp;<strong>&quot;What - Me Worry?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Time stops.</p>
<p>Suddenly it's as if my skull has been cracked open and emptied out. In an instant, my mind stops sizzling in its habitual static. In the vibrant silence that follows, I realize that this sizzle is what's called &quot;worry,&quot; and that, until this moment, I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. My mind - freed at last from whipping itself through all those tortuous channels of how-come's and what-if's - becomes blissful clarity, perfect peace. I feel like an endless sky from which ancient, toxic clouds have been suddenly blown away. I am, in fact, floating in a bona fide state of satori, and I continue to float through the rest of the afternoon, the evening, the movie (<em>Parrish</em>, a plantation soap opera starring Troy Donohue), till bedtime, when I float blissfully into sleep.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit term for this phenomenon is&nbsp;<em>mahavakya</em>&nbsp;- &quot;great utterance.&quot; When a master realizes that a disciple's mind has reached a moment of particular ripeness, he or she utters one of the classic formulations of cosmic Reality, perhaps a line from the Upanishads, such as &quot;Thou art That.&quot; And whammo: the disciple clearly, experientially Gets It. In my case the master was Sri Guru-ji Alfred E. Neuman. Well, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>Or maybe not so mysterious. Maybe the Infinite reveals itself in ways that are exquisitely tuned to time, place, and audience. The most nagging worry of adolescents (<em>Mad</em>'s traditional readership) is physical appearance. Is my chest too small? Is my nose too big? Braces? Acne? Alfred E. Neuman has splotchy freckles, protruding ears, ridiculous cheekbones, impossible hair, gap teeth, cockeyes ...&nbsp;<em>and he doesn't worry!</em>&nbsp;Cheerfully oblivious to his funny looks, he embodies the teenager's chronic worry and explodes it away in the tension-release of laughter.</p>
<p>We Cold War kids also had some special, acute worries, which Alfred showed up just in time to ease. We grew up doing &quot;drop drills&quot; - huddling in silence under our desks with our hands clasped over the backs of our heads, waiting to see whether the next moment would bring nuclear Armageddon or the teacher's all-clear. And precisely in that moment of breathless, fearful anticipation lies the problem. Two thousand years earlier, Jesus diagnosed the condition and prescribed the cure:</p>
<blockquote>
	<em>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.</em></blockquote>
<p>The futility of worry is rooted in the element of time: worry is the agitated anticipation of what the world may do to us in the near or distant future. (Resentment is the agitated recollection of what the world did to us in the past. Guilt is the agitated recollection of what we did to the world - and often a convenient form of self-flagellation that allows us to keep doing it.)</p>
<p>The cure for worry, then (and resentment and guilt), is to live right now. This is not just some happy-face spiritual slogan, but the starkest realism - in fact it's our only option. We worry about tomorrow, but we always wake up today. It's never tomorrow, never five minutes from now, never one second from now. (When the future arrives, please raise your hand.) There's no time but the present, and even that is suspect.</p>
<blockquote>
	<em>In meditation you can see through the illusion of past, present, and future - your experience becomes the continuity of Nowness. The past is only an unreliable memory held in the present. The future is only a projection of your present conceptions. The present itself vanishes as soon as you try to grasp it. So why bother with attempting to establish the illusion of solid ground?</em>&nbsp;<br />
	- H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche</blockquote>
<p>Relinquishing the illusion of solid ground may seem scary at first; it does mean going into a kind of endless free-fall. But we're falling in delicious, total freedom indeed, with the growing realization that just as there is no ground to support us, there is no ground ever to hit.</p>
<p>Does living in liberated Nowness mean we can't work on Monday to get a paycheck on Friday? Or that we're not responsible for what we did in June because it's October? No - that would be flakiness, not enlightenment. We earn the right to be blas&eacute;&nbsp;about the illusory past and future only by being conscientious in the perpetual present. To the extent that we're functioning in a time-bound apparent world, we have to deal sensibly today with the seeds of probable tomorrows. But we don't have to be lost in agitation over the ways they may sprout.</p>
<p>This distinction became clear to me some twenty years after my&nbsp;<em>Mad</em>&nbsp;experience, in another automotive epiphany. A friend was driving me through some aggressively congested New Jersey traffic. He was holding forth passionately on some topic or other, making lots of emphatic gestures, looking to me for nods of agreement, and failing to note much of the sudden braking and lane-changing going on around him. Soon I felt my right foot stomping on the brake - the imaginary passenger-side brake that I had used for years in similar situations. Then suddenly, in mid-stomp, I realized:&nbsp;<em>This brake doesn't work.&nbsp;</em>It doesn't stop the car; it doesn't slow it down even a little. If the situation is truly dangerous, I should ask the driver to let me out (or better, to let me drive). Otherwise, I may as well relax and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>I decided to renounce that imaginary brake. But suppressing the urge to stomp on it caused a whole new set of unpleasant sensations. My breathing grew constricted as I struggled to stifle my anxiety, and the tension I had denied to my right leg crept up into my gut. (Years later I became friends with some cops involved in dangerous assignments and discovered that they all had serious gastrointestinal problems.) Suppression, I realized, merely drives worry deeper into the psyche and the body, there to grow more toxic, resurfacing later in some other guise. So then I truly let go, of both worry and suppression. I breathed freely, my muscles relaxed, my tension evaporated.</p>
<p>We also have an&nbsp;<em>internal</em>&nbsp;passenger-side brake, which we stomp on incessantly. Worry about work, worry about family, worry about health ... all involve futile straining for that brake and tensing ourselves against imagined crashes up the road. Whenever there is a practical way to grab the steering wheel of our destiny (work smarter, talk through the family problem, eat our healthy vegetables), we should certainly do so, but beyond that we may as well just breathe out and let go. Having done what we can, we can relax into the spacious freedom of simply Being and let whatever happens happen - which it will do whether we &quot;let&quot; it or not.</p>
<blockquote>
	<em>You have claim to your actions only; to their fruits you have no claim.</em>&nbsp;<br />
	- Bhagavad Gita</blockquote>
<p>This realization - that once we've done our best the chips are&nbsp;<em>going</em>&nbsp;to fall where they may - is profoundly liberating. But only if we want to be liberated. One stormy evening as I was leaving the school where I teach, I saw a mother standing under the front portico, peering anxiously up the driveway through the lightning and rain. She was, she explained, waiting for the bus to bring her son back from a fencing meet. When I suggested that she could relax in the faculty lounge with a cup of coffee, she smiled tightly: &quot;No, I'll stay out here - I'm a worrier.&quot; Although worrying couldn't get the bus there a minute earlier, her job description as a good mother apparently required it. To stop would be to let go of that strained, unproductive self-definition, probably lifting considerable pressure off her children as well as herself.</p>
<p>If you had done everything in the past exactly the same except for the worrying, what would be different? What will you ever do in the future that worrying will improve?</p>
<blockquote>
	<em>while you worry about what each note means,&nbsp;<br />
	the band plays on.</em>
	<p><em>you are running from a dog&nbsp;<br />
		who only chases because you run.<br />
		turn and face him.</em></p>
	<p><em>though you hear the buzzing of the bee grow louder&nbsp;<br />
		be still.&nbsp;<br />
		do not fear a sting you have never felt,&nbsp;<br />
		you just might be a flower.</em></p>
	<p><em>do not worry&nbsp;<br />
		about things falling into place.&nbsp;<br />
		where they fall&nbsp;<br />
		is the place.&nbsp;</em><br />
		- Mark Hartley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suggestions for further practice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Quit worrying (wouldn't you quit any other job that paid so poorly?), or at least take vacations. Breathe out and take your foot off that internal passenger-side brake for a day, an hour, even a moment. As you gain confidence that your universe does not crumble without the tension of worry to hold it together, extend your vacations.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		If that seems too hard, start by watching yourself worrying: &quot;Ah, yes, this is called worry, it's something I choose to do.&quot; If even that's too hard, observe the worry of others. Note how much of their energy it consumes, and how it distorts the patterns of mind, speech, and body.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Meditate. (More on this later.) The taste of transcendental ease that you catch through meditative practice will feed your faith that somehow everything's fundamentally okay. When you wake in the middle of the night gripped by anxiety, even the faint, lingering flavor of that transcendence can keep you you from being overwhelmed.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		A yet more profound liberation into Nowness comes from abandoning hope as well as worry. But that's an advanced technique.</li>
